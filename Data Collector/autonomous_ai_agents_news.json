        "full_content": "I've shipped AI agent projects for big banks, tiny service businesses, and everything in between. And I gotta be real with you, what you're reading online about this stuff is mostly fantasy.\n\nThe demos are slick. The sales pitches are great.\n\nThen you actually try to build one. And it gets ugly, fast.\n\nI wish someone had told me this stuff before I started.\n\nFirst off, the software you're already using is gonna be your biggest enemy. Big companies have systems that haven't been touched in 20 years. I had one client, a logistics company, where the agent had to interact with an app running on Windows XP. No joke. We spent months just trying to get the two to talk to each other.\n\nAnd it's not just the big guys. I worked with a local plumbing company that had their customer list spread across three different, messy spreadsheets. The agent we built kept trying to text reminders to customers from 2012.\n\nThe \"AI\" part is a lot easier than the \"making it work with your ancient junk\" part. Nobody ever budgets for that.\n\nPeople love to talk about how powerful the AI models are. Cool. But they don't talk about what happens when your shiny new agent makes a mistake at 2 AM and starts sending weird emails to your best customers.\n\nI had a client who wanted an agent to handle simple support tickets. Seemed easy enough. But the first time it saw a question it didn't understand, it just... made up an answer. Confidently wrong. Caused a huge headache.\n\nWe had to go back and build a bunch of boring stuff. Rules for when it should just give up and get a human. Logs for every single decision it made. The \"smart\" agent got a lot dumber, but it also became a lot safer to actually use.\n\nEveryone wants to start by automating their whole business.\n\n\n\n\"Let's have it do all our sales outreach!\"\n\nStop. Just stop.\n\nThe only projects of mine that have actually succeeded are the ones where we started ridiculously small. I worked with an insurance broker. Instead of trying to automate the whole claims process, we started with one tiny step: checking if the initial form was filled out correctly.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nIt worked. It saved them a few hours a week. It wasn't sexy. But it was a win. And because it worked, they trusted me to build the next piece.\n\nYou have to earn the right to automate the complicated stuff.\n\n  \nOh, and your data is probably a disaster.\n\nSeriously. I've spent more time cleaning up spreadsheets and organizing files than I have writing prompts. If your own team can't find the right info, how is an AI supposed to?\n\nThe AI isn't magic. It's just a machine that reads your stuff really fast. If your stuff is garbage, you'll just get garbage answers, faster.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the cost. That fancy demo where the agent thinks for a second before answering? That's costing you money every single time it \"thinks.\" I've seen monthly AI bills triple overnight because a client's agent was being too chatty.\n\nSo if you're thinking about this stuff for your business, please, lower your expectations.\n\nStart with one, tiny, boring problem.  \nAssume your current tech will cause problems.  \nAnd plan for a human to be babysitting the thing for a long, long time.\n\nIt's not \"autonomous.\" It's just a new kind of helper. And it's a very needy one right now.\n\nAm I just being cynical, or is anyone else actually deploying this stuff seeing the same thing? Curious what it's like for others in the trenches."

I'd rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion\n\nEdit 2: If you'd like to tip you can tip here [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil). Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support \ud83d\ude4f\n\nYou can read the free newsletter [here](https://nofil.beehiiv.com/)\n\nFun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours\n\nEdit: So many people ask why I don't get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn't have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don't have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.\n\n(I'm not associated with any tool or company. Written and collated entirely by me, no chatgpt used)"
